summary: I always wanted to make a blog to record my journey into the world of Computer Science. It took me 4 semesters to finally get one.

## Initial purpose

I always believe that if I want to showcase something, it has to be perfect, polished, and has
value to other people. That's what I thought back in my 2nd semester. Besides, one's blog is a
reflection of one's self, right? While the intention is good, sometimes being simple is enough.

To put it simply, I made the most sinful decision a software engineer can make. **Premature Abstraction**.

It led to this blog's delay for 4 semesters long. "But why does it take you so long to build a
simple blog?" you might ask, "Isn't it trivial?."

Well, yes, it is trivial. The blog itself isn't the problem, but the thought that I could do
this from scratch is. Yes, full-fledged blog, with markdown parsers, from scratch. I naively jumped
into the rabbit hole of parsers, and lexers thought finishing the blog during
winter break would be possible. I took it too far.

No, I did not finish the blog, obviously. I simply didn't have enough knowledge to build a parser by
myself. I should've stopped there, but I keep going instead.

A few months passed, and Ryan Dahl announced a new javascript runtime called Deno. "I need to build
my blog using Deno," my shiny object syndrome screams. And it only goes downhill from that.

Long story short, I abandoned all of my side projects, including a few iterations of my blog, and
started over. I finally realized why my friends called me a masochist.

## This blog is up ðŸŽ‰

Yay, a dream comes true! But I already forgot stories in my freshman years. The reason I want a blog
is for me to record my journey into computer science, and I'm already finished my 5th semester.

It's a significant loss for me, but dwelling on my past mistake wouldn't help much. I really hope I
can make this blog helpful for everyone in the future. Writing down my mistakes would _hopefully_
prevent others from making the same mistake.

Thank you for reading my story. Hopefully, I will get better at writing stories over time.
Stay safe, everyone.
